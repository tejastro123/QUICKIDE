# 🧠 Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages the principles of **quantum mechanics** to perform operations on data. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), **quantum computers use qubits**, which can represent **0, 1, or both simultaneously** due to the property of **superposition**.

This makes quantum computers incredibly powerful for solving certain types of problems that are intractable for classical machines.

## 🔢 What is a Qubit?

A **qubit** (quantum bit) is the basic unit of information in quantum computing.

### Key Properties of Qubits

- **Superposition**: A qubit can exist in a combination of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states simultaneously.
  
  > Example: \|ψ⟩ = α\|0⟩ + β\|1⟩, where α and β are complex numbers satisfying |α|² + |β|² = 1

- **Entanglement**: Two or more qubits can become entangled such that the state of one depends on the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.

- **Measurement**: Observing a qubit collapses its state to either 0 or 1 probabilistically, based on its superposition.

## 🧰 Quantum Hardware Types

There are several physical implementations of qubits. Each technology has advantages and challenges:

| Hardware Type              |                   Description                                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Superconducting Qubits** | Use circuits cooled near absolute zero. Used by IBM, Google.               |
| **Trapped Ions**           | Use charged atoms held in electromagnetic traps. High fidelity.            |
| **Photonic Qubits**        | Use particles of light (photons). Room-temperature operation.              |
| **Spin Qubits**            | Use electron spins in semiconductors. Compatible with existing chip tech.  |
| **Topological Qubits**     | Theoretical. Use exotic particles called anyons. Promising for stability.  |
